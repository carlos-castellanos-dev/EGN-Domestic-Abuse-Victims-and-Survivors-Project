# EGN-Domestic-Abuse-Victims-and-Survivors-Project
Website to Assist Domestic Abuse Victims and Survivors 
# Project Overview:  
This project revolves around the research conducted by Professor Joan Meier, which 
states that victims of domestic abuse have known for decades that woman who report abuse 
when they try and leave their relationship will not only be disbelieved but will be retaliated 
against. Furthermore, when mothers report abuse to the courts, despite credited evidence of 
abuse, child abuse, or child sexual abuse, they will likely lose custody of their children and fail to 
protect them from abuse. The gender bias in our system, court professionalsâ€™ immunity, lack of 
oversight, and lack of transparency, make accountability for biased and harmful decisions 
impossible. This project consists of developing a website /database that crowdsources data of 
court actors, claims of abuse, responses, outcomes, upload evidence or any information that 
can be helpful in empowering victims and survivors. The end goal of this project is to collect 
enough data to offer a tool for transparency, accountability, and systemic reform for victims of 
domestic abuse who have passed through or are currently in family court.
